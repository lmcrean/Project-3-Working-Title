This readme introduces the key features of the project, using the framework of the 5 planes of User Experience. It summarises key challenges addressed along the way and also provides credits and acknowledgesments at the end.

An [issues.md](https://github.com/lmcrean/Crocodile-Kingdom/blob/main/issues.md) file is dedicated to the most specific technical account of important issues and bugs that were researched and solved during the project.

# 2. Manual Testing with the UX Development Planes

</div>

**The 5 UX development planes were used as an efficient framework for documenting the project's intentions.** 


**Manual testing focused on the functionality of the JS logic and CSS visuals:**

Using the latter 3 UX Planes as a guideline:
- **For the Structure plane, JS logic and HTML hyperlinks** functionality within each feature, using console.log() to check that the code was running as expected.
- **For the Skeleton plane, CSS positioning and responsivity to viewport width**, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). 
- **For the Surface plane, design choices through vector graphics, typography, color and sound** that serve the user stories and elicit a positive emotional response. CSS was the key programming language and Canva was used for rendering graphic illustrations.

### 2.1.4. User Stories & business goals

The business goals were to provide users with a fun and engaging quiz that would promote careers in STEAM. The user stories were developed to meet the business goals.

<div align="center"><h3> User Stories testing</h3>

<img src="assets/media/userimg.png" width="800">

 </div>

**Business stories**
I need to promote Careers in STEAM

I need to use CRUD logic

I need footers at the bottom to promote my brand

**User Stories Scope**

I need a quiz that provides me with personal feedback on a certain holistic level.
 - the user takes a personality quiz at the beginning of the session.
 - the user takes a quiz on STEAM subjects.
 - the user receives a personal report at the end of the session, summarising their personality, academic knowledge and suggesting what qualities they might have for a career in STEAM.

I need a quiz that provides me with broader feedback that relates to other users.
 - the user is given a rank in the leaderboard, and is shown how many users have completed the quiz.
 - the user is told what rank they came in their most knowledgeable subject, in relation to other users. E.g. ```You came 5th in Science.```
 - the user is told what percentage they came in their strongest personality trait, in relation to other users. E.g. ```You scored in the top 20% for Openness.```

I want option to retake the quiz
- the user can easily navigate back to the menu

I need my identity to be anonymous as there is sensitive data being handled
 - the user is asked to enter a username at the beginning of the session.
 - the user is asked to use a Moniker, and is double checked to confirm that their input is not their real name.

**Structure**
I need all the controls to navigate the test successfully

I need the quiz to show me my overall STEAM high score and assess my high score on individual sections.

I need to see my rank in the leaderboard. (If I completed the quiz faster than a user of the same rank, I deserve to be a higher rank)

I need each section to select 10 random MCQs from a large database

**Skeleton needs**
I need to see the logo consistently throughout the game

I need to track my high score throughout the game

I need the all the text to fit in the 80 by 80 box

**Surface needs**
I would like to see a ASCII decorated logo

I would like to have my terminal centered with a background

## 2.2. Scope plane

It was important to choose a project that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 6 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- **Developing the Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point simultaeneously.** This way, the essential product would be met in time with the deadline, and the unique features would keep me motivated.

[‚Üë Back to top](#Steam-Test)

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>

### 2.2.1. Mininum Viable Product features

A mininum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future development.

<i>
The minumum viable product was

- a navigation menu with START, HIGH SCORES and HOW TO PLAY
- a quiz with 10 questions per section
- 5 sections of questions on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. From a database of 50 questions per section.
- a high score with a username, score, timestamp and rank. 
- option to restart the quiz
- open-close information about careers in STEAM

</i>

***


### 2.2.2. Unique Selling Point features

The unique selling point features were designed to meet the needs of new players, and to make the game more engaging and fun.

<i>
- Personality report with a unique personality type for each player, suggests what career the student might enjoy.
- Gambling game that reveals student's attitude to risk
</i>

## 2.3. Structure Plane

This Structure plane summarises the structure of each feature by highlighting most essential HTML, CSS and JS functions for the feature to work. The developer also used this as a workflow for drafting in the features.

![[passed](http://www.shields.io)](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI_Python_Linter_(PEP8)-passed-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&color=green&logoColor=green)

The Validator used was the Code Institute PEP8 Python Linter. https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/

While this was the main validator used, the developer also used the following validators to check the code:

- PyLint for quickly spotting long lines of code and other errors. https://www.pylint.org/

## 3.4. Deployment

</div> 

The project was deployed on Heroku. The following steps were taken:

1. Create a new app on Heroku
2. Add the following buildpacks in the following order:
    1. heroku/python
    2. heroku/nodejs
3. Connect the app to the Github repository
4. Deploy the app

## 4.1. Cannot access OpenTrivia DB for Tech, Art and Maths.

</details></div>

Under "Now on to Art!" and "Now on to Math!" it should reveal the quiz. Should also work for an earlier technology section.

It works for Science and English.

This is likely because the OpenTrivia DB API not active for the specific category.

**Solution: Removed Easy difficulty.**

In long term, best solution would be to migrate to local JSON database, as json files are saved.

<div align=center><details><summary><b> click here to view the issue output</summary></b>
