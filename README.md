# Steam Test: a fun cross-curricular quiz for students <!-- omit in toc -->

</div>

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div><br>

This readme introduces the key features of the project, using the framework of the 5 planes of User Experience. It summarises key challenges addressed along the way and also provides credits and acknowledgesments at the end.

An [issues.md](https://github.com/lmcrean/Crocodile-Kingdom/blob/main/issues.md) file is dedicated to the most specific technical account of important issues and bugs that were researched and solved during the project.

# 2. Manual Testing with the UX Development Planes

</div>

**The 5 UX development planes were used as an efficient framework for documenting the project's intentions.** 


**Manual testing focused on the functionality of the JS logic and CSS visuals:**

Using the latter 3 UX Planes as a guideline:
- **For the Structure plane, JS logic and HTML hyperlinks** functionality within each feature, using console.log() to check that the code was running as expected.
- **For the Skeleton plane, CSS positioning and responsivity to viewport width**, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). 
- **For the Surface plane, design choices through vector graphics, typography, color and sound** that serve the user stories and elicit a positive emotional response. CSS was the key programming language and Canva was used for rendering graphic illustrations.

### 2.1.4. User Stories & business goals

The business goals were xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

<div align="center"><h3> User Stories testing</h3>

<img  src="assets/media/documentation/userimage.svg" width="900px" >
 </div>

**Business stories**
I need to promote Careers in STEAM

I need CRUD logic

I need footers at the bottom

User stories

**Scope**
I need a quiz that tests me on STEAM subjects

I need to check my high score

I want option to update my high score and username

I want to be able to delete my high score

**Structure**
I need all the controls to navigate the quiz successfully

I need the quiz to show me my overall high score and assess my high score on individual sections.

I need to see my rank in the leaderboard. (If I completed the quiz faster than a user of the same rank, I deserve to be a higher rank)

I need each section to select 10 random MCQs from a large database

I need a time limit of 5 minutes for each section

**Skeleton needs**
I need to see the logo consistently throughout the game

I need to track my high score throughout the game

I need the all the text to fit in the 80 by 80 box

**Surface needs**
I would like to see a ASCII decorated logo

I would like to have my terminal centered with a background


<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>

## 2.2. Scope plane

It was important to choose a project that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 6 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- **Developing the Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point simultaeneously.** This way, the essential product would be met in time with the deadline, and the unique features would keep me motivated.

<div align=center><img src="assets/media/documentation/color-line-break.png" width="800"></div>

### 2.2.2. Mininum Viable Product features

A mininum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future development.

<i>
The minumum viable product was

- a navigation menu with START, HIGH SCORES and HOW TO PLAY
- a quiz with 10 questions per section
- 5 sections of questions on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics
- a high score with a username, score, timestamp and rank. 
- option to restart the quiz
</i>

***


### 2.2.3. Unique Selling Point features

The unique selling point features were designed to meet the needs of new players, and to make the game more engaging and fun.

<i>
- consistent header display in terminal
- if players have the same rank, the player who completed the quiz faster will be ranked higher
- incorperation of extension challenges e.g. unique games
- ASCII header
- custom feedback for each section
</i>

## 2.3. Structure Plane

This Structure plane summarises the structure of each feature by highlighting most essential HTML, CSS and JS functions for the feature to work. The developer also used this as a workflow for drafting in the features.
