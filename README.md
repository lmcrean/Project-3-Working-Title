This readme introduces the key features of the project, using the framework of the 5 planes of User Experience. It summarises key challenges addressed along the way and also provides credits and acknowledgesments at the end.

An [issues.md](https://github.com/lmcrean/Crocodile-Kingdom/blob/main/issues.md) file is dedicated to the most specific technical account of important issues and bugs that were researched and solved during the project.

# 2. Manual Testing with the UX Development Planes

</div>

**The 5 UX development planes were used as an efficient framework for documenting the project's intentions.** 


**Manual testing focused on the functionality of the JS logic and CSS visuals:**

Using the latter 3 UX Planes as a guideline:
- **For the Structure plane, JS logic and HTML hyperlinks** functionality within each feature, using console.log() to check that the code was running as expected.
- **For the Skeleton plane, CSS positioning and responsivity to viewport width**, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view (768px), laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px+). 
- **For the Surface plane, design choices through vector graphics, typography, color and sound** that serve the user stories and elicit a positive emotional response. CSS was the key programming language and Canva was used for rendering graphic illustrations.

## 2.2. Scope plane

For the scope plane, the developer drafted a mininum viable product that informed a scope of features designed to meet the needs of new players.

### 2.2.1. Scope Strategy

It was important to choose a project that was achievable in the time frame, and that had a lot of resources available.

The project was researched, conceived and designed in 6 weeks. Important limitations of the project had to be set from the outset such as
- **choosing a "well-trodden" path that had lots of tutorials and resources available.** This was to ensure that the project was achievable in the time frame, and that the developer could learn from the resources available.
- **Developing the Mininum Viable Product and Unique Selling Point simultaeneously.** This way, the essential product would be met in time with the deadline, and the unique features would keep me motivated.

### 2.2.2. Mininum Viable Product features

A mininum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future development.

<i>
The minumum viable product was

### 2.2.3. Unique Selling Point features

The unique selling point features were designed to meet the needs of new players, and to make the game more engaging and fun.

## 2.3. Structure Plane

This Structure plane summarises the structure of each feature by highlighting most essential HTML, CSS and JS functions for the feature to work. The developer also used this as a workflow for drafting in the features.
